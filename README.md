MLP Neural Network in Python 3

The number of hidden layers, and the size of the hidden layers, can be specified. The network is then constructed iteratively with the appropriate initial weights and biases. The activation function can be specified (ReLU, sigmoid or tanh) for the hidden layers. The learning rate and regularisation strength can also be specified.
